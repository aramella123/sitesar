    "yext/body": "The money market refers to trading in very short\\-term debt investments. At the wholesale level, it involves large\\-volume trades between institutions and traders. At the retail level, it includes money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers.  \nIn all of these cases, the money market is characterized by a high degree of safety and relatively low rates of return.  \n**KEY TAKEAWAYS**\n\n\nThe money market involves the purchase and sale of large volumes of very short\\-term debt products, such as overnight reserves or commercial paper. An individual may invest in the money market by purchasing a money market mutual fund, buying a Treasury bill, or opening a money market account at a bank. Money market investments are characterized by safety and liquidity, with money market fund shares targeted at $1. 1:25 Money Market Understanding the Money Market The money market is one of the pillars of the global financial system. It involves overnight swaps of vast amounts of money between banks and the U.S. government. The majority of money market transactions are wholesale transactions that take place between financial institutions and companies.  \nInstitutions that participate in the money market include banks that lend to one another and to large companies in the eurocurrency and time deposit markets; companies that raise money by selling commercial paper into the market, which can be bought by other companies or funds; and investors who purchase bank CDs as a safe place to park money in the short term. Some of those wholesale transactions eventually make their way into the hands of consumers as components of money market mutual funds and other investments.  \nIn the wholesale market, commercial paper is a popular borrowing mechanism because the interest rates are higher than for bank time deposits or Treasury bills, and a greater range of maturities is available, from overnight to 270 days.1﻿ However, the risk of default is significantly higher for commercial paper than for bank or government instruments.  \nIndividuals can invest in the money market by buying money market funds, short\\-term certificates of deposit (CDs), municipal notes, or U.S. Treasury bills. For individual investors, the money market has retail locations, including local banks and the U.S. government\u0027s TreasuryDirect website. Brokers are another avenue for investing in the money market.  \nThe U.S. government issues Treasury bills in the money market, with maturities ranging from a few days to one year.2﻿ Primary dealers buy them in large amounts directly from the government to trade between themselves or to sell to individual investors. Individual investors can buy them directly from the government through its TreasuryDirect website or through a bank or a broker. State, county, and municipal governments also issue short\\-term notes.",
